## Project Description
This project is a web form built for a Digital Product Management class assignment. The project helps strengthen awareness and skills in HTML and CSS.

## How Webform Conforms to Best Practices for Forms
Each input field is labeled and has descriptive text to go along with it. This helps create a better understanding for the author and the viewer. Clarity is also provided with the descriptions. It makes it less confusing viewers and easy to follow along.

Bootstrap is a method incorporated in the project as well. This creates a more clean and efficient layout for users to follow. The overall user experience is better with Bootstrap being implemented. Radio and checkbox alignment are also maintained with bootstrap.

## Accessibility for Users
Labels were given to corresponding fields in the web form. The color contrast makes it easy to follow. The font and font size are easy to read. Tooltips were also provided for users as well.
